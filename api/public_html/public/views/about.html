We have created filters which are chosen at sign up that will only display bills related to your areas of interest. Also, we've included a search bar so you can find and vote on bills like the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.</p><h4>Let us do the heavy lifting</h4><p>Easy Ballot automatically remembers your representatives and their Repworthiness.
