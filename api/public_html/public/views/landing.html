While you visit this site, you can pretend that <i>YOU</i> were elected to congress. Vote on as many of the same bills which congress's last session voted as you want. After each vote, get an instant update and find out whether your represenatives actually voted with you or against you. Easy Ballot automatically remembers your representatives and their Repworthiness. Repworthiness is a percentage calculated by comparing your votes to your representatives' votes. Easy Ballot works to help you keep things straight come November. It's easy. Even an opposing party member could use it.</p><h4>Filters and Bill Search</h4><p>Not everyone is directly affected by amendments to the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937. We have created filters which are chosen at sign up that will only display bills related to your areas of interest. Also, we've included a search bar so you can find and vote on bills like the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.</p><h4>Keep It Simple</h4><p>This app can be viewed on your phone or ipad easily and is just as clear as its desktop equivalent. The official phone app is coming soon!</p></div></div></div>
