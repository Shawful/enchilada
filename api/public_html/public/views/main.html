I built it last night. Pretty cool, huh? I used some other stuff to help me along the way.</p><h4>Angular</h4><p>AngularJS is an MVC frmework. That means nothing to you, but it means I can use it to build cool web apps.</p><h4>Karma</h4><p>Spectacular Test Runner for JavaScript.</p><h4>Ngrok</h4><p>Ngrok allows me to write the code on my machine and then test it on the web. Normally websites are built locally on someone's machine and the code is moved to the cloud so the site can handle all of the retweets from your Oscar selfie (without crashing). Ngrok allows my machine to act as the cloud and give you and anyone, anywhere access to my app.</p></div><div class="footer"><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart"></span> from the Shaw development team</p></div>
